Q1: Write a Program to make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and
divide using functions

Solution :

print("""1.Add\n2.Subtract\n3.Multiply\n4.Divide""")

while(True):
    num = int(input("enter yout choice between 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 :"))
    a = int(input("Enter number a :"))
    b = int(input("Enter number b :"))
    match num:
        case 1 :
            print("The sum of the two numbers are :" , a+b)
        case 2 :
            print("The Subtraction of a - b is :", a-b ," and the subtraction of b-a is :" ,  b-a)
        case 3 :
            print("The multiplication of a and b is : ", a*b)
        case 4 :
            print("The Dividation of a / b is : " , a/b )
        
    n = int(input("do you want to continue next operation (0/1) :"))
    if(n==0):
        break
        

Q 2: Write a Function of version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes
such as "Go hanga salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a
potato pan, Otis", "LisaBonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed
under it as a tired nude Maori","Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". Note
that punctuation, capitalization, andspacing are usually ignored.


Solution :

sentences = ("Go hanga salami I'm a lasagna hog.",
"Was it a rat I saw?",
"Step on no pets",
"Sit on a potato pan, Otis",
"LisaBonet ate no basil",
"Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas",
"I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori",
"Rise to vote sir",
"Dammit, I'm mad!")

def ispallindrome(a):
    print(a)
    a.replace(" ","")
    for char in a :
        if(not char.isalnum()):
            a=a.replace(char,"")
    a=a.lower()
    if(a[:]==a[::-1]):
        print("given sentence is pallindrome.\n")
    else:
        print("Given sentence is not pallindrome.\n")

for sentence in sentences:
    ispallindrome(sentence)
    
    
Q3. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once,
forexample: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a function
to check asentence to see if it is a pangram or not.

Solution :

s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
s = s.replace(" ","")
def checkpangram(s):
    a = tuple(range(ord("a"),ord("z")+1))
    b = dict.fromkeys(a,0)
    s = s.lower()
    for ch in s:
        b[ord(ch)]+=1

    for value in b.values():
         if(value==0):
             print("all alphabates are not available")
             break
         else:
             print("all alphabates are available")
             break

checkpangram(s)


Q4. Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least
onemember in common, False otherwise.

Solution :
a = [1,2,3,4]
b=[5,6,7,8]

c = [1,2,3,4]
d=[4,5,6,7]

def overlapping(a,b):
    flag=0
    for ch in a :
        if(ch in b):
            print("True")
            print(ch)
            flag=1
            break
    if(flag==0):
        print("False")
    

print(a," ",b)
overlapping(a,b)
print(c," ",d)
overlapping(c,d)


Q5. Write a function find_longest_word() that takes a list of words and returns the length of the
longest one.

solution :

a = ['shivam', 'shiv', 'largeword']
def find_longest_word(a):
    maxvalue = 0
    index = 0
    for i in a :
        if(len(i)>maxvalue):
           maxvalue = len(i)
           index = a.index(i)
    print("maximun length word is \"" ,a[index] , "\" and its length is " , maxvalue , ".")

find_longest_word(a)


Q6: write a Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term where n is provided by
the user

n = 7
fibsum = 0
prev =1
curr = 1
for i in range(n):
    if(i<=1):
        fibsum = 1
        print(fibsum,end=" ")
        
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = fibsum 
        fibsum = prev + curr
        print(fibsum,end=" ")
print()
print(fibsum)



Q7: Write a Python Program to Display Powers of 2 Using Anonymous Function
( Lambda function). Take number of terms from user


a = int(input("enter your number here : "))
b = lambda x : x ** 2 
b(a)


Solution :
s = int(input("enter the size of the list :"))
a = []
for i in range(s):
    c = int(input("enter your number here :"))
    a.append(c)

print(a)

b = list(map(lambda x : x ** 2 , a))
print(b)


"""
Q9. Write a program that simulates a traffic light . The program should consist of the following:
1. A user defined function trafficLight( ) that accepts input from the user, displays an error
message if the user enters anything other than RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. Function light() is
called and following is displayed depending upon return value from light().
a) “STOP, your life is precious” if the value returned by light() is 0.
b) “Please WAIT, till the light is Green “ if the value returned by light() is 1
c) “GO! Thank you for being patient” if the value returned by light() is 2.
2. A user defined function light() that accepts a string as input and returns 0 when the input is
RED, 1 when the input is YELLOW and 2 when the input is GREEN. The input should be
passed as an argument.
3. Display “ SPEED THRILLS BUT KILLS” after the function trafficLight( ) is executed.

Solution :

def trafficlight():
    a = ""
    colourcode = 0

    while(True):
        a = input("enter yout colour here (red , green , yellow ) :")

        case 2 :
            print("GO! Thank you for being patient")

Q10: Write a Python program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term by using
recursive functions

n = 7
fib_series = []
def f_series(a):
    if(a <= 0):
        return []
    elif(a==1):
        return [0]
    elif(a==2):
        return[0,1]
    else:
        fib_series = f_series(a-1)
        nextFib = fib_series[-1]+fib_series[-2]
        fib_series.append(nextFib)
        return fib_series

result = f_series(n)
print(result)
print("The fibonacci of ", n , " is : " , result[-1])


Q11: Write a Python program to find the sum of natural numbers up to n using recursive function


a = 7
naturalNum = []
def natural_numbers_sum(n):
    if(n==1):
        return [1]
    elif(n<0):
        return [1]
    else:
        naturalNum = natural_numbers_sum(n-1)
        
        naturalNum.append(naturalNum[-1]+1)
